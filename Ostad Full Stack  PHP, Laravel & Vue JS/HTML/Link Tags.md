##### **External links:**
- **These are links that lead to other websites. ``The target="_blank"`` attribute opens the link in a new tab or window.**

##### **Internal links:**
- **These links lead to different sections within the same web page. They use the # symbol followed by the id of the destination element. In this example, clicking on "Go to Section 1" will navigate the user to the part of the page where ``<h2 id="section1">`` is defined.**

##### **Email link:**
- **The ``mailto:`` protocol in the ``href`` attribute creates a link that opens the user's default email client with the address specified in the link.**

##### **Telephone link:**
- **The ``tel:`` protocol creates a link that, when clicked on a device capable of making phone calls, will start a call to the specified number.**
